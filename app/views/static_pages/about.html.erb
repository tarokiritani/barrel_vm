<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Taro Kiritani. I am a postdoc in neuroscience, working at the Petersen Lab, EPFL, Switzerland. My interest is in the processing of sensorymotor information in the brain, and its underlying neuronal circuits. I previously worked in Gordon Shpherd's Lab at Northwestern University in Chicago as a PhD student.</p>
<h1>About My Project</h1>
<p>The network operation in the neocortex is mediated by interactions of various neuron types. However, the functional roles of specific neuron types is largely unknown. I use mouse whisker sensory cortex (wS1) as a model to study how information is encoded and processed in the brain.</p>

<p>I use in-vivo whole cell recordings under two-photon imaging, to understand how information is encoded and processed by specific neurons. The membrane potential dynamics of excitatory, parvalbumin-expressing (PV), somatostatin-expressing (Sst), and vasopressin-expressing (VIP) neurons in layer 2/3 (L2/3) and layer 4 (L4) of mouse whisker somatosensory cortex (wS1) have been recorded during spontaneous whisking in air, and active sensation.</p>
<h1>About This Website</h1>
<p>I believe in open science, and have been wondering how I can effectively share experimental data with other neuroscientists. That is why I made this web app where you can interactively see my electrophysiology data, as well as whisker traces. The data can be downloaded from here. My analyses and code (jupyter ntoebooks) are also publicly available. If you are interested in my data, or have any questions regarding my project, do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
